Where $p_{ij}=\{q_{ij}min(1,\frac{u_j}{u_i})\}$

## Task 1
Write out a proof that P is reversible with respect to $\mu$. Conclude that $\mu$ is an invariant probability distribution for P.
For $P$ to be irreducible with respect to $\mu$, we must show that:

\[\mu_i p_{ij}=\mu_j p_{ji} \hspace{.5cm} \forall \hspace{.1cm} i,j\]

Recall that $Q$ is symmetric (i.e $q_{ij}=q_{ji}$), as this is key to the reversibility of $P$.

Now, given by the definition of $P$, we have that:

\[p_{ij}=q_{ij}min(1,\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_i})\]

and we also have that: 

\[p_{ji}=q_{ji}min(1,\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_j})=q_{ij}min(1,\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_j})\]

From here, we can deal with different cases for the $\mu$'s, taking into account that we know $\mu_k$ is strictly positive for all $k$, and thus their ratios are strictly positive as well. We will show, that in all cases, reversibility holds true. 

CASE 1: $\mu_i<\mu_j$
    
Notice that this implies that $\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_j}<1$ and $\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_i}>1$
Therefore, we can conclude that
\[p_{ij}=q_{ij}min(1,\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_i})=q_{ij}\cdot 1=q_{ij}\]
and \[p_{ji}=q_{ij}min(1,\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_j})=q_{ij}\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_j}\]
Let us plug these values of $p_ij$ and $p_ji$ into the reversibility equality to see if it holds.
\[\mu_i q_{ij}=\mu_j q_{ij}\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_j}\]
which simplifies to:
\[\mu_i q_{ij}=\mu_i q_{ij}\]
The equality holds true, and thus the condition for reversibility of $P$ is satisfied.

    
CASE 2: $\mu_i\geq\mu_j$
    
This case is analogous to that of the first.
Notice that this implies that $\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_j}\geq 1$ and $\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_i}\leq 1$

Therefore, we can conclude that
\[p_{ij}=q_{ij}min(1,\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_i})=q_{ij}\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_i}\]
and \[p_{ji}=q_{ij}min(1,\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_j})=q_{ij}\cdot 1=q_{ij}\]
As we did before, let us plug these values of $p_ij$ and $p_ji$ into the reversibility equality to see if it holds.
\[\mu_i q_{ij}\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_i}=\mu_j q_{ij}\]
which simplifies to:
    \[\mu_j q_{ij}=\mu_j q_{ij}\]
    
The equality holds true, and thus the condition for reversibility of $P$ is satisfied.
    
As this proof is for any arbitrary states $i$ and $j$ in $P$, we can conclude that $P$ is indeed reversible with respect to $\mu$.


## Task 2
Write out a proof that that $P$ is irreducible, and that if $\mu$ isnt perfectly uniform then 
P is aperiodic. [Hint: Show that if $i \to j$ under $Q$ then $i \to j$ under $P$. For aperidocity, consider a site where where a transition can occur]

## Task 3
Check that $Q$ is symmetric.
