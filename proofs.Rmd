Where $p_{ij}=\{q_{ij}min(1,\frac{u_j}{u_i})\}$

## Task 1
Write out a proof that P is reversible with respect to $\mu$. Conclude that $\mu$ is an invariant probability distribution for P.

## Task 2
Write out a proof that that $P$ is irreducible, and that if $\mu$ isnt perfectly uniform then 
P is aperiodic. [Hint: Show that if $i \to j$ under $Q$ then $i \to j$ under $P$. For aperidocity, consider a site where where a transition can occur]

## Task 3
Check that $Q$ is symmetric.
